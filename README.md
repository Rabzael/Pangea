## Modules
The whole project is divided in modules. All the documentation in the ['docs'](./docs/) folder:

| #  | Name  | Description     | Languages |
|----|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| [00](docs/00-proxy.md) | Proxy | A forward proxy | Go        |

My beloved wife and my wonderful kids, who let me some spare time here and there to purse my hobbies.
