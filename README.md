> A simple and simplified forward-proxy-caching-IDS-AI-log-analyzer comprehensive system, made for self-educational purpose.

Long story short: with the help of ChatGPT I found some ideas to practice my *coding skills* (!) and learn something new about networks, data, AI...

## Modules
The whole project is divided in modules. All the documentation in the ['docs'](./docs/) folder:

| #                      | Name  | Description     | Languages |
|------------------------|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| [00](docs/00-proxy.md) | Proxy | A forward proxy | Go        |
| [01](docs/01-etl.md)   | ETL   | Log ETL tool    | Rust      |

## Special thanks to
My beloved wife and my wonderful kids, who let me some spare time here and there to purse my hobbies.
